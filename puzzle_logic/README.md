**Logic Architecture**
*Usage Guide*

**1.** ***Initializing a game***

In order to initialize the game, the *UI* object must instantiate the *LOGIC*. This is done by simply calling the class. Once an instance exists, a player can be created by calling the *init_player* function. The function takes three variables:
*1. Health-Points, 2. Number of hints, 3. Category*
In order to stay consistent, the category is picked via an enum-class: *Category*.
```
logic = Logic() # the logic object
logic.init_player(5,5, Category.FOOD) # 5 HP, 5 Hints, Category = Food
```
**2. *Getters***

The logic layer has multiple functions for retrieving useful data.
```
logic.get_hp() #returns the players current HP
logic.get_hints_left() # returns how many hints the player has left
logic.get_hint() # returns a random hint
```
There are also functions for checking if the game should end.
```
logic.player_is_alive() # True if player is alive, False if not
logic.player_won() # True if player has found all correct words, False if not
```

**3.** ***Making a move***

When a player makes a move, the process of validating this move is straight-forward.
The function *new_move* takes the swedish word along with the english word. The Logic object will take care of updating the players health-points. The workflow we propose for this action is to: *1. make a move, 2. update the visuals via get functions and check if the player is still alive OR has won the game.*
```
logic.new_move('Ã¤pple', 'pear')
logic.get_hp() 
logic.player_is_alive() # return True as long as the HP is not 0
logic.player_won() # returns True if all the correct words has been found
```
The *new_move* function tracks which words have been correctly selected. If an English word is submitted and successfully matched with the corresponding Swedish word, it cannot be submitted again. Attempting to do so will result in an exception, as this action should not be possible.

**4. *Validation feedback on character selection***

We have introduced a validation function that processes coordinate inputs $(x, y)$. When a user taps a coordinate that belongs to a word, the function returns $1$. If the subsequent tap is adjacent and still part of the same word, it continues returning $1$. When the user completes the word by selecting its final character, the function returns $2$. If the tap is not on a connected character, tracking is discontinued and the function returns $0$.
The function can be used as an action to a button press 
```
logic.validate(5,7) # validates x=5, y=7
```
**5. *Other notes***
- The game grid is generated dynamically based on the selected category.

- The Logic class is designed to be modular and extendable for future features.

- Developers can introduce additional word categories by modifying the WordList class.
